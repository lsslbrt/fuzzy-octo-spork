        <p class="first">While we can't help but get excited about a new jelly sheet mask or limited-edition coconut butter, it's important to remind ourselves that some of the most effective self-care practices tend to be the simplest &mdash; for example, the act of getting a good night's sleep. Of course, the idea that sleep is essential to your health certainly isn't new &mdash; its benefits are well documented, and you can feel its obvious physical and mental effects when you have (or haven't) had enough of it. And yet, we're still struggling with sleep in a lot of ways &mdash; whether it's consistently catching enough high-quality z's, or hitting that elusive target of a 10pm  bedtime. So, how can you optimize your nightly shut-eye to wake up with a slept-in-on-vacation glow? Grab a pillow and keep reading to find out.</p>

        <p class="largertext">If you've fallen into a pattern of late nights and snooze-button mornings, reset your routine by starting with the basics &mdash; planning and implementing a new sleep-wake schedule.</p>

        <p>Planning your sleep-wake schedule is really just selecting what time you'll go to sleep and wake up every day. However, from a scientific perspective, when determining the optimal hour to go to bed and exactly how many hours of sleep you need, the reality is that each individual's needs are somewhat unique. <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2015.00100/full?utm_source=FRN&utm_medium=ECOM&utm_campaign=FBK_FNEUR_1505_latefly" target="_blank">Studies</a> have found that your genes largely mediate your chronotype (your propensity to be either a night owl or an early bird) and the number of hours of sleep that will allow you to feel refreshed and alert in the morning. That being said, there are some general science-based guidelines you can follow to create a schedule that you're able to maintain.</p>

        <p class="ptitle">Go to sleep between 8pm and midnight.</p>
        <p>The period of time when you're actually asleep is comprised of a series of several 90-minute cycles. During each cycle, your brain moves from deep, non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep to REM sleep. While the length of each cycle stays pretty consistent throughout the night, the ratio of non-REM to REM sleep within  each cycle changes depending on the time of night. This means that regardless of what time you fall asleep, you'll experience more non-REM sleep in the earlier hours of the night and more REM sleep in the later hours of the night (past 3am). A bedtime roughly within the 8pm-midnight window will allow for an optimal balance of both non-REM and REM sleep.</p>

        <p class="ptitle">Get at least 7 hours of sleep every night.</p>
        <p>The National Sleep Foundation <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/S2352-7218(15)00015-7/pdf" target="_blank">recommends</a> that adults ages 18–64 get between 7–9 hours of sleep every night, and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society both <a class="articlelink" href="https://aasm.org/resources/pdf/pressroom/adult-sleep-duration-consensus.pdf" target="_blank">recommend</a> that adults sleep 7 or more hours every night on a regular basis, warning that sleeping less is associated with adverse health effects like weight gain, depression, and heart disease. Nevertheless, the best way to determine exactly how many hours of sleep you need each night is to conduct this sleep experiment: Every night for two weeks, adhere to a consistent bedtime. Turn off your morning alarm and record what time you naturally wake up each day. Once you've established a pattern, you can adjust your sleep-wake schedule as needed. If you don't have the luxury of ignoring your alarm for two weeks, try thinking back to what your sleep habits looked like during your last alarm-free vacation, and estimate from there.</p>

        <p class="largertext">Once you've determined your ideal sleep-wake schedule, it's time to get on it. Making small changes over time is the most effective way to stick to your schedule long-term.</p>

        <p>Based on your new schedule, chances are your current bedtime and wake-up time are both later than you'd like them to be. To correct this, start by shifting your morning alarm by 5 minutes each day, allowing your body to gradually acclimate to an earlier wake-up time. Although this sounds tedious, it's probably the most effective way to train yourself to consistently wake up earlier &mdash; without having to fight the daily urge to hit the snooze button.</p>

        <p>Now here's where things get harder &mdash; if you're actively trying to shift your sleep-wake schedule, it's best not to sleep in on weekends. If you need to, set a weekend alarm for no more than an hour later than your weekday alarm. Even worse news &mdash; naps should also be avoided. While there are studies to suggest naps improve your mood, decrease stress, and are generally just good for your health &mdash; they can also throw off your circadian rhythm. If you do choose to take naps, keep them short. While there are varying studies on how long a nap should be for optimum health benefits, the general consensus is to limit each to 30 minutes.</p>

        <p>Of course, in conjunction with waking up earlier, you'll also need to adhere to a consistent bedtime every night &mdash; which can be equally challenging. For instance, if you've ever planned to go to bed early, but instead ended up watching Netflix until 3am for no defensible reason &mdash; you're not alone. This type of behavior is actually a very real physiological phenomenon called <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062817/" target="_blank">bedtime procrastination</a>. Bedtime procrastination is basically the result of less-than-perfect self-regulation skills &mdash; interestingly, it's thought to involve the same mental processes as "cheating" on a diet. So how can you combat that inherent impulse to keep scrolling mindlessly on Instagram when you should be going to bed? Try setting a nightly bedtime alarm &mdash; it will act as an auditory cue to snap you out of the sleepy, zombie-like mental state that leads you to procrastinate at night.</p>

        <p class="largertext">While incrementally shifting your alarm is an effective method for altering your sleep-wake schedule, the real game-changer is understanding how melatonin impacts your circadian rhythm.</p>

        <p>Melatonin is a natural hormone your brain produces to make you sleepy. It's present in your body at low levels during the day, but production increases a few hours before bedtime and peaks in the middle of the night. Exposure to light suppresses melatonin production, which is why your melatonin levels rise after the sun goes down, prepping your body for sleep. Unfortunately, it's not just sunlight that lowers your melatonin levels &mdash; any kind of natural or artificial light can suppress melatonin production to a degree. <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831986/" target="_blank">Studies</a> have shown that melatonin levels are affected the most by short-wavelength blue light, which is commonly emitted by electronics. Basically, this means that if you're on your device just before bed, your circadian clock will shift to a later sleep-wake schedule &mdash; making it that much harder to stick to achieving your early bird goals.</p>

        <p>The most effective way to avoid blue light exposure in the evening is to stop using your light-emitting electronics 2-3 hours before bed. However, a more realistic option is to simply use a warm light setting on your devices. <a class="articlelink" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513" target="_blank">Night Shift</a> is an Apple setting that uses your device's clock and geolocation to automatically shift the colors in your display to the warmer end of the spectrum after sunset, reducing the amount of blue light emitted by your screen. This feature is referred to as "Night Mode" on Android devices.</p>

        <p>So now we know that melatonin is vital to a restful sleep &mdash; but whether you should take it as a nightly supplement is another question. It's important to note that while melatonin helps tell your body when it's time to go to sleep, it doesn't actually make you fall asleep. That being said, melatonin supplements can be useful for the first week you're trying to reset your internal clock (they're also proven to reduce jet lag symptoms), but are not a long-term solution for insomnia or other sleep disorders.</p>
