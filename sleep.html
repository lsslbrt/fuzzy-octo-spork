        <p>I know, I know. The idea that sleep is essential to your health isn’t new — its benefits are well documented, and you can feel its obvious physical and mental effects when you have (or haven’t) had enough of it. And yet, we’re still struggling with sleep in a lot of ways — whether it’s getting enough quality sleep every night, or hitting that elusive target of a 10pm  bedtime. So, what can you do to optimize your nightly sleep-wake cycles? Keep reading to find out.</p>

        <p class="largertext">When is the best time to go to sleep? How many hours of sleep should I get every night?</p>

        <p>When it comes to determining what time you should go to bed and exactly how many hours of sleep you should be getting, the reality is that each individual’s needs are somewhat unique. <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2015.00100/full?utm_source=FRN&utm_medium=ECOM&utm_campaign=FBK_FNEUR_1505_latefly" target="_blank">Studies</a> have found that your genes largely mediate your chronotype — your propensity to be either a night owl or an early bird — as well as the number of hours of sleep that will allow you to feel refreshed and alert in the morning. That being said, there are some general science-based guidelines you can follow when planning your sleep schedule.</p>

        <p><span class="parheader">Go to sleep between 8pm — midnight.</span>The period of time when you’re actually asleep is comprised of a series of 90-minute cycles. During each cycle, your brain moves from deep, non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep to REM sleep. While the length of each cycle stays pretty consistent throughout the night, the ratio of non-REM to REM sleep within  each cycle changes depending on the time of night. This means that regardless of what time you fall asleep, you’ll experience more non-REM sleep in the earlier hours of the night and more REM sleep in the later hours of the night (past 3am). A bedtime roughly within the 8pm — midnight  window will allow for an optimal balance of both non-REM and REM sleep.</p>

        <p><span class="parheader">Get at least 7 hours of sleep every night.</span>The National Sleep Foundation <a class="articlelink" href="http://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/S2352-7218(15)00015-7/pdf" target="_blank">recommends</a> that adults ages 18–64 get between 7–9 hours of sleep every night, and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society both <a class="articlelink" href="https://aasm.org/resources/pdf/pressroom/adult-sleep-duration-consensus.pdf" target="_blank">recommend</a> that adults sleep 7 or more hours every night on a regular basis, warning that sleeping less than 7 hours is associated with adverse health effects like weight gain, depression, and heart disease. Nevertheless, the best way to determine exactly how many hours of sleep you need each night is to conduct this two-week sleep experiment: Every night for two weeks, adhere to a consistent bedtime. Turn off your alarm and record what time you naturally wake up in the morning. Once you’ve established a pattern, you can adjust your sleep schedule as needed. If you don’t have the luxury of ignoring your alarm for two weeks, an alternative would be to think back to what your sleep habits looked like during your last alarm-free vacation, and estimate from there.</p>

        <p class="largertext">Ok, I know what time I want to go to sleep and wake up. Now how do I actually do it?</p>

        <p>Chances are your current bedtime and wake-up time are both later than your ideal. To correct this, start by shifting your morning alarm by 5 minutes each day, allowing your body to gradually acclimate to an earlier wake-up time. Although this sounds tedious, it's probably the most effective way to train yourself to consistently wake up earlier - without having to fight the daily urge to hit the snooze button.</p>

        <p>Of course, in conjunction with waking up earlier, you'll also need to adhere to a consistent bedtime - which can be equally challenging. For instance, if you've ever planned to go to bed early, but instead ended up watching Netflix until 2am for no legitimate reason - you're not alone. This type of behavior is actually a very real physiological phenomenon called <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062817/" target="_blank">bedtime procrastination</a>. Bedtime procrastination is basically the result of less-than-perfect self-regulation skills - interestingly, it's thought to involve the same mental processes as say, eating a cupcake when you're supposed to be on a sugar detox. So how can you combat that inherent impulse to keep scrolling mindlessly through your Instagram feed when you should really be going to sleep? Try setting a nightly bedtime alarm - it will act as an auditory cue to snap you out of the sleepy, zombie-like mental state that leads you to procrastinate at night.</p>

        <p><span class="parheader">What about sleeping in on weekends?</span>Unfortunately, if you want to maintain momentum, it's best to not sleep in on weekends. You should set your weekend alarm for no more than an hour later than your weekday alarm — any later will throw off your circadian rhythm.</p>
