                  <p>I know, I know. The idea that sleep is essential to your health isn’t at all new — its benefits are well documented, and you can feel its obvious physical and mental effects when you have (or haven’t) had enough of it. And yet, we’re still struggling with sleep in a lot of ways — whether it’s getting enough quality sleep every night, or hitting the elusive target of a 10pm  bedtime. So how can you optimize your sleep-wake cycles? Keep reading to find out.</p>
                  
                  
                  <p class="subheader">The Perfect Sleep Schedule</p>
                  
                  <p>When it comes to determining what time you should go to bed and exactly how many hours of sleep you should be getting, the reality is that each individual’s needs are somewhat unique — to an extent, your genes dictate whether you’re a night owl or an early bird, as well as the number of hours of sleep that will allow you to feel refreshed and alert in the morning. That being said, there are some general science-based guidelines you can follow when planning your sleep schedule.</p>
                  
                  <p class="subheader">Go to sleep between 8pm-midnight.</p>
                  
                  <p>The time you’re asleep is comprised of a series of 90-minute cycles during which your brain moves from deep, non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep to REM sleep. While the 90-minute duration of each cycle remains fairly consistent during the period which you’re asleep, the ratio of non-REM to REM sleep within  each cycle changes based on the time of night. This means that regardless of what time you fall asleep, you’ll experience more non-REM sleep in the earlier hours of the night and more REM sleep in the later hours of the night (~3am). A bedtime roughly within the 8pm-midnight window will allow for an optimal balance of both non-REM and REM sleep.</p>
                  
                  <p class="subheader">Sleep for at least 7 hours every night.</p>
                  
                  <p>The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults ages 18–64 get between 7-9 hours of sleep every night, and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society both recommend that adults sleep 7 or more hours every night on a regular basis, warning that sleeping less than 7 hours is associated with adverse health effects like weight gain, depression, and heart disease. Nevertheless, the best way to determine exactly how many hours of sleep you need every night is to conduct this sleep experiment: Every night for two weeks, adhere to a consistent bedtime. Turn off your alarm and record what time you naturally wake up in the morning. Once you’ve established a pattern of how many hours of sleep you need each night, you can adjust your bedtime as needed to accommodate your morning schedule.</p>
         
                  <p>You know when you say you’re going to go to bed at a reasonable hour, but end up watching Netflix until 2am for no good reason? It’s called bedtime procrastination, and it’s a very real phenomenon. Bedtime procrastination is basically the result of low self-regulation skills — interestingly, it’s thought to involve the same mental process as failing to resist eating a cupcake when you’re dieting. So how can you combat the inherent impulse to watch the next episode of <i>Black Mirror</i> under the covers? Try setting a nightly bedtime alarm — it will act as a cue to snap you out of the foggy mental state that keeps you procrastinating.</p>
