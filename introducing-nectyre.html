        <p>It's true what they say about living in New York City. No, I'm not referencing the perpetual 45 minute wait for a table at brunch, though that is true &mdash; what I mean is that in New York City, there's always something new to do, see, shop, and eat. Lately, during my daily commute to the Flatiron District, I've been noticing this newness in various forms of high-end health, beauty, and fitness boutiques. The 6-block stretch is now home to athleisure brands <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.bandier.com/" target="_blank">Bandier</a> and <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.lululemon.com/" target="_blank">Lululemon</a>, Dr. Frank Lipman's <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.elevenelevenwellness.com/" target="_blank">Eleven Eleven Wellness Center</a>, fitness studios <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.y7-studio.com/" target="_blank">Y7</a>, <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.sbxboxing.com/" target="_blank">Shadowbox</a>, <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.sltnyc.com/" target="_blank">SLT</a>, and not one, but two <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.soul-cycle.com/" target="_blank">Soulcycles</a>. With the <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.traciemartyn.com/pages/nyc-spa.com/" target="_blank">Tracie Martyn Spa</a>, <a class="articlelink" href="https://sbskin-nyc.com" target="_blank">SB Skin</a>, and the recent opening of the NYC flagship for natural Korean beauty brand <a class="articlelink" href="https://us.innisfree.com/" target="_blank">Innisfree</a>, the area might as well be promoted as New York City's "Wellness District."</p>

        <p>While my heart flutters a little every time I stumble upon a new organic juice bar or infrared yoga studio, in the back of my mind, I sometimes wonder if all this wellness is making me… unwell.</p>

        <p>Fundamentally, the idea behind wellness is positive &mdash; it's about making a conscious, self-directed effort to attain health in your mind and body through things like diet, exercise, and self-care. Seems like a good thing, right?</p>

        <p>It is. Or, at least it should be.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the wellness industry doesn't earn a substantial profit from consumers who eat more leafy greens or get an extra hour of sleep at night. So instead, marketers are using pseudoscience mixed with trendy aesthetics in order to sell expensive and gratuitous products.</p>

        <p>This is what leads us to pay $10 for a glass bottle of lemon-flavored dirt water. Oh uh, I mean "activated charcoal lemonade."</p>

        <p>Reading through the blog of Gwyneth Paltrow's New Age lifestyle brand <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.goop.com" target="_blank">Goop</a>, every article seems to tout a newly discovered method for "living your best life." <i>Use <a class="articlelink" href="https://goop.com/wellness/spirituality/the-8-essential-crystals/" target="_blank">carnelian crystal</a> to treat period cramps and infertility! Hack your weight loss genes using alpha-lipoic acid and <a class="articlelink" href="https://goop.com/wellness/health/how-to-hack-the-genes-that-impact-weight-loss-metabolism/" target="_blank">green tea catechins</a>!</i> The scientific-sounding terminology and complicated protocols that often make up these articles are part of the appeal &mdash; when faced with the reality of having to consistently diet and exercise month over month in order to look and feel my best, it's particularly seductive to think that there is some super-secret knowledge I can pay for that will fast-track my body to supermodel status. Unsurprisingly, Goop has its own label of skincare products, supplements, and more. That <a class="articlelink" href="https://shop.goop.com/shop/products/the-goop-medicine-bag" target="_blank">carnelian crystal</a>? It comes in a stylish Goop-branded pouch and will cost you $85, while the alpha-lipoic acid and green tea catechin dietary <a class="articlelink" href="https://shop.goop.com/shop/products/high-school-genes" target="_blank">supplement</a> will cost you $90… for a 30-day supply.</p>

        <p>In these instances, it's somewhat easy to spot the pseudoscience which should help you resist buying the wellness snake oil &mdash; but sometimes, the line between science and marketing is harder to define. For example, turmeric, a bright yellow spice often used in curries, is commonly touted as a superfood with anti-inflammatory properties &mdash; and with many articles reporting on its purported health benefits and centuries-long history in traditional medicine, it's easy to believe in the power of this so-called "golden spice." Unfortunately, in January 2017, a review was published of the scientific literature on curcumin, the most well-known compound in turmeric, which revealed that it has <a class="articlelink" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00975" target="_blank">limited, if any,</a> actual health benefits. But even with this new information, the spice is still incredibly popular. Today, turmeric supplements are being sold alongside ibuprofen, and photos of "golden lattes" are frequently posted by wellness influencers on social media.</p>

        <p class="quote">"Health is all the stuff that you know you should do. Wellness is all the peripheral shit that someone marketed to you because it sounded almost like health." &mdash; <a class="quotelink" href="https://theoutline.com/post/350/the-sickening-business-of-wellness" target="_blank">The Sickening Business of Wellness</a></p>

        <p>Here's the thing though &mdash; as much as I shame the wellness industry, I also have to admit that I'm one of its biggest patrons. I buy the lemon-flavored dirt water. I buy the detox teas, the 3lb ankle weights, and right now my wish list includes <a class="articlelink" href="https://anese.co/products/anese-collagen-booty-mask" target="_blank">this</a> $35 firming collagen mask for your butt. I'd like to say it's all for my health, but if I'm being completely honest, I buy these products with the ultimate goal of following in the footsteps of women who live an instagrammable "hashtag-wellness" lifestyle.</p>

        <p>You know &mdash; women with glowy, bare-faced skin and shiny, fluffy, undone hair. Women who have the confidence to wear sports bras without shirts. Women who eat greens without needing to hide them in smoothies!</p>

        <p class="caption">Common themes seen in my Instagram feed. Supermodels drinking green juice, supermodels at the spa, supermodels working out.</p>

        <p>But I'm still not there, and here's why: In pursuing my interest in wellness, I've thoroughly overdosed on news and trends &mdash; and it's lead me to create a complicated, overloaded daily routine that is not only completely unrealistic, but that I sabotage with every new article I read.</p>

        <p>Every Sunday, I repeat the same train of thought:</p>

        <p><i>Okay, my best life starts now. On Monday morning, I'm going to wake up early, drink a glass of warm lemon water, complete a 15-minute sun salutation yoga sequence, then go to the gym for a 45-minute interval treadmill workout.</i></p>

        <p>I add lemons to my grocery list.</p>

        <p><i>Then, before I take a shower I'll dry brush my body to stimulate my lymphatic system, and after I'll apply organic coffee bean body oil to reduce cellulite.</i></p>

        <p>I suddenly realize that while I vowed to add dry brushing and oil moisturizing to my routine, I purchased the body oil but forgot to buy a body brush. A potential crisis, but I'm able to keep it together. I place an online order for a natural cactus-bristle brush and reassure myself that it's okay to hold off on the dry brushing part of my routine until my order arrives next week.</p>

        <p>Now, here's where things go south:</p>

        <p><i>For breakfast, I'll make a green smoothie with spinach, blueberries, almond milk… oh, and I just read that mushroom powder has a lot of antioxidants, so I should add that &mdash; <a class="articlelink" href="https://www.moonjuice.com" target="_blank">Moon Juice</a> sells both Cordyceps and Reishi powder, which one should I buy? Their website says Cordyceps is a "system nourisher," but Reishi is a "spirit nourisher" &mdash; WTF does that mean?</i></p>

        <p>A few hours later, mentally exhausted after falling down an internet rabbit hole that began with researching the adaptogenic properties of various mushroom varieties, I order buffalo wings with extra blue cheese and decide to put off planning my best life until next weekend. Of course, before then, I'm sure I'll read about some new miracle ingredient I'll feel like I have to incorporate into my routine, and the cycle will continue.</p>

        <p>So, I've decided to do something about it. This blog is my attempt at breaking that cycle. I'm going to attempt to simplify wellness by stripping away the pseudoscience and doubling-down on the basics. In this blog, you'll read about the validity of health, beauty, and fitness trends. In addition, I'll be providing things like realistic, science-backed exercise tips and routines, food and skincare ingredient breakdowns and research, and simple mix & match recipes that don't taste like sadness (I'm sorry, but apple cider vinegar is not an acceptable salad dressing).</p>

        <p>Obligatory disclaimer: I'm not a nutritionist, health coach, doctor, or scientist. I'm just a curious girl trying to level up. Follow along &mdash; let's make wellness less aspirational and more attainable.</p>

        <p>X,<br>Lyssa</p>
